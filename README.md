# Weather App JavaScript

This is my take on a Weather App JavaScript that I created using HTML, CSS, BootStrap and javaScript. I added a screen shot of the running App also added a video that shows the functionality of the Weather App.

## Technologies

- HTML to write the structure of the website.
- CSS and BootStrap to style the website.
- JavaScript to add the functionality to the Weather app.
- OpenWeatherMap Api to get the Weather data. 

## Editors

- [Microsoft Visual Studio code:](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) this an awesome all around editor that is highly recommended by most software and web developers.
- [Notepad ++:](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) this a very light weight code editor that packs a big punch.
